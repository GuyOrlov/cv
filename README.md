## Projects
### The Dashboard focuses on the Economic inactivity of Disabled People
I want to shift the focus towards economic inactivity and draw comparisons between disabled and non-disabled people. This subject is often considered **taboo**, but the insights from these reports could greatly benefit educators and training providers.
The goal is to help them understand how to support disabled individuals in returning to work, provide motivation, and serve as role models. The impact of these factors can vary depending on the individual‚Äôs region within the UK.
